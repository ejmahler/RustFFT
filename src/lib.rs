//! RustFFT is a high-performance FFT library written in pure Rust.
//!
//! RustFFT supports the AVX instruction set for increased performance. No special code is needed to activate AVX:
//! Simply plan a FFT using the FftPlanner on a machine that supports the `avx` and `fma` CPU features, and RustFFT
//! will automatically switch to faster AVX-accelerated algorithms.
//!
//! For machines that do not have AVX, RustFFT also supports the SSE4.1 instruction set.
//! As for AVX, this is enabled automatically when using the FftPlanner.
//!
//! ### Usage
//!
//! The recommended way to use RustFFT is to create a [`FftPlanner`](crate::FftPlanner) instance and then call its
//! [`plan_fft`](crate::FftPlanner::plan_fft) method. This method will automatically choose which FFT algorithms are best
//! for a given size and initialize the required buffers and precomputed data.
//!
//! ```
//! // Perform a forward FFT of size 1234
//! use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};
//!
//! let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
//! let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(1234);
//!
//! let mut buffer = vec![Complex{ re: 0.0f32, im: 0.0f32 }; 1234];
//! fft.process(&mut buffer);
//! ```
//! The planner returns trait objects of the [`Fft`](crate::Fft) trait, allowing for FFT sizes that aren't known
//! until runtime.
//!
//! RustFFT also exposes individual FFT algorithms. For example, if you know beforehand that you need a power-of-two FFT, you can
//! avoid the overhead of the planner and trait object by directly creating instances of the [`Radix4`](crate::algorithm::Radix4) algorithm:
//!
//! ```
//! // Computes a forward FFT of size 4096
//! use rustfft::{Fft, FftDirection, num_complex::Complex, algorithm::Radix4};
//!
//! let fft = Radix4::new(4096, FftDirection::Forward);
//!
//! let mut buffer = vec![Complex{ re: 0.0f32, im: 0.0f32 }; 4096];
//! fft.process(&mut buffer);
//! ```
//!
//! For the vast majority of situations, simply using the [`FftPlanner`](crate::FftPlanner) will be enough, but
//! advanced users may have better insight than the planner into which algorithms are best for a specific size. See the
//! [`algorithm`](crate::algorithm) module for a complete list of scalar algorithms implemented by RustFFT.
//!
//! Users should beware, however, that bypassing the planner will disable all AVX and SSE optimizations.
//!
//! ### Feature Flags
//!
//! * `avx` (Enabled by default)
//!
//!     On x86_64, the `avx` feature enables compilation of AVX-accelerated code. Enabling it greatly improves performance if the
//!     client CPU supports AVX and FMA, while disabling it reduces compile time and binary size.
//!
//!     On every platform besides x86_64, this feature does nothing, and RustFFT will behave like it's not set.
//! * `sse` (Enabled by default)
//!
//!     On x86_64, the `sse` feature enables compilation of SSE4.1-accelerated code. Enabling it improves performance
//!     if the client CPU supports SSE4.1, while disabling it reduces compile time and binary size. If AVX is also
//!     supported and its feature flag is enabled, RustFFT will use AVX instead of SSE4.1.
//!
//!     On every platform besides x86_64, this feature does nothing, and RustFFT will behave like it's not set.
//!
//! ### Normalization
//!
//! RustFFT does not normalize outputs. Callers must manually normalize the results by scaling each element by
//! `1/len().sqrt()`. Multiple normalization steps can be merged into one via pairwise multiplication, so when
//! doing a forward FFT followed by an inverse callers can normalize once by scaling each element by `1/len()`
//!
//! ### Output Order
//!
//! Elements in the output are ordered by ascending frequency, with the first element corresponding to frequency 0.
//!
//! ### AVX Performance Tips
//!
//! In any FFT computation, the time required to compute a FFT of size N relies heavily on the [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization) of N.
//! If N's prime factors are all very small, computing a FFT of size N will be fast, and it'll be slow if N has large prime
//! factors, or if N is a prime number.
//!
//! In most FFT libraries (Including RustFFT when using non-AVX code), power-of-two FFT sizes are the fastest, and users see a steep
//! falloff in performance when using non-power-of-two sizes. Thankfully, RustFFT using AVX acceleration is not quite as restrictive:
//!
//! - Any FFT whose size is of the form `2^n * 3^m` can be considered the "fastest" in RustFFT.
//! - Any FFT whose prime factors are all 11 or smaller will also be very fast, but the fewer the factors of 2 and 3 the slower it will be.
//!     For example, computing a FFT of size 13552 `(2^4*7*11*11)` is takes 12% longer to compute than 13824 `(2^9 * 3^3)`,
//!     and computing a FFT of size 2541 `(3*7*11*11)` takes 65% longer to compute than 2592 `(2^5 * 3^4)`
//! - Any other FFT size will be noticeably slower. A considerable amount of effort has been put into making these FFT sizes as fast as
//!     they can be, but some FFT sizes just take more work than others. For example, computing a FFT of size 5183 `(71 * 73)` takes about
//!     5x longer than computing a FFT of size 5184 `(2^6 * 3^4)`.
//!
//! In most cases, even prime-sized FFTs will be fast enough for your application. In the example of 5183 above, even that "slow" FFT
//! only takes a few tens of microseconds to compute.
//!
//! Some applications of the FFT allow for choosing an arbitrary FFT size (In many applications the size is pre-determined by whatever you're computing).
//! If your application supports choosing your own size, our advice is still to start by trying the size that's most convenient to your application.
//! If that's too slow, see if you can find a nearby size whose prime factors are all 11 or smaller, and you can expect a 2x-5x speedup.
//! If that's still too slow, find a nearby size whose prime factors are all 2 or 3, and you can expect a 1.1x-1.5x speedup.
