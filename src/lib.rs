//! RustFFT is a high-performance FFT library written in pure Rust.
//!
//! This is an experimental release of RustFFT that enables AVX acceleration.
//!
//! ### Usage
//!
//! The recommended way to use RustFFT is to create a [`FftPlanner`](crate::FftPlanner) instance and then call its
//! [`plan_fft`](crate::FftPlanner::plan_fft) method. This method will automatically choose which FFT algorithms are best
//! for a given size and initialize the required buffers and precomputed data.
//!
//! ```
//! // Perform a forward FFT of size 1234
//! use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};
//!
//! let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
//! let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(1234);
//!
//! let mut buffer = vec![Complex{ re: 0.0f32, im: 0.0f32 }; 1234];
//! fft.process_inplace(&mut buffer);
//! ```
//! The planner returns trait objects of the [`Fft`](crate::Fft) trait, allowing for FFT sizes that aren't known
//! until runtime.
//!
//! RustFFT also exposes individual FFT algorithms. For example, if you know beforehand that you need a power-of-two FFT, you can
//! avoid the overhead of the planner and trait object by directly creating instances of the [`Radix4`](crate::algorithm::Radix4) algorithm:
//!
//! ```
//! // Computes a forward FFT of size 4096
//! use rustfft::{Fft, FftDirection, num_complex::Complex, algorithm::Radix4};
//!
//! let fft = Radix4::new(4096, FftDirection::Forward);
//!
//! let mut buffer = vec![Complex{ re: 0.0f32, im: 0.0f32 }; 4096];
//! fft.process_inplace(&mut buffer);
//! ```
//!
//! For the vast majority of situations, simply using the [`FftPlanner`](crate::FftPlanner) will be enough, but
//! advanced users may have better insight than the planner into which algorithms are best for a specific size. See the
//! [`algorithm`](crate::algorithm) module for a complete list of scalar algorithms implemented by RustFFT.
//!
//! ### Normalization
//!
//! RustFFT does not normalize outputs. Callers must manually normalize the results by scaling each element by
//! `1/len().sqrt()`. Multiple normalization steps can be merged into one via pairwise multiplication, so when
//! doing a forward FFT followed by an inverse callers can normalize once by scaling each element by `1/len()`
//!
//! ### Output Order
//!
//! Elements in the output are ordered by ascending frequency, with the first element corresponding to frequency 0.
