[features]
default = ["avx", "sse", "neon"]

# On x86_64, the "avx" feature enables compilation of AVX-acclerated code. 
# Similarly, the "sse" feature enables compilation of SSE-accelerated code. 
# Enabling these improves performance if the client CPU supports AVX or SSE, while disabling them reduces compile time and binary size.
# If both are enabled, RustFFT will use AVX if the CPU supports it. If not, it will check for SSE4.1.
# If neither instruction set is available, it will fall back to the scalar code.  
#
# On AArch64, the "neon" feature enables compilation of Neon-accelerated code.
#
# On wasm32, the "wasm_simd" feature enables compilation of Wasm SIMD accelerated code.
#
# For all of the above features, on every platform other than the intended platform for the feature, these features do nothing, and RustFFT will behave like they are not set.
