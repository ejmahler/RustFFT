[features]
default = ["avx"]

# On x86_64, the "avx" feature enables compilation of AVX-acclerated code. Enabling it improves performance if the client CPU supports AVX, while disabling it reduces compile time and binary size.
# On every other platform, this feature does nothing, and RustFFT will behave like it's not set.
