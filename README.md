RustFFT is a high-performance FFT library written in pure Rust. It can compute FFTs of any size, including prime-number sizes, in O(nlogn) time.

RustFFT supports the AVX instruction set for increased performance. No special code is needed to activate AVX: Simply plan a FFT using the FftPlanner on a machine that supports the `avx` and `fma` CPU features, and RustFFT will automatically switch to faster AVX-accelerated algorithms.

Unlike previous major versions, RustFFT 5.0 has several breaking changes compared to RustFFT 4.0. Check out the [Upgrade Guide](/UpgradeGuide4to5.md) for a walkthrough of the changes RustFFT 5.0 requires.

## Usage

```rust
// Perform a forward FFT of size 1234
use rustfft::{FFTplanner, num_complex::Complex};

let mut planner = FFTplanner::<f32>::new();
let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(1234);

let mut buffer = vec![Complex{ re: 0.0, im: 0.0 }; 1234];

fft.process(&mut buffer);
```

## Supported Rust Version

RustFFT requires rustc 1.37 or newer. Minor releases of RustFFT may upgrade the MSRV(minimum supported Rust version) to a newer version of rustc.
However, if we need to increase the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been released at least six months ago.

## Stability/Future Breaking Changes

Version 5.0 contains several breaking API changes. In the interest of stability, we're committing to making no more breaking changes for 3 years, aka until 2024.

This policy has one exception: We currently re-export pre-1.0 versions of the [num-complex](https://crates.io/crates/num-complex) and [num-traits](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits) crates. If those crates release new major versions, we will upgrade as soon as possible, which will require a major version change of our own. If this happens, the version increase of num-complex/num-traits will be the only breaking change.
